# Proof-of-Concept (POC) Web Application for Financial Transaction Fraud Detection

# Streamlit

- Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. It’s all Python, open-source, and free! 

- And once we have created an app, we can use Streamlit cloud platform to deploy, manage, and share app!

<p align = 'justify'> Streamlit: Creating and sharing stunning, personalised web apps for machine learning and data science 
is simple with the help of the open-source Python library Streamlit. After we've developed an app, we 
can deploy, manage, and share it using the Streamlit cloud platform.
</p>

<p align = 'justify'> To build the Web Application, we will use the 10 most important features obtained through Explainable 
AI methods that help predict the probability of financial transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, since it 
would be a pain for a front-end user to fill all features on the web app.
</p>

<p align = 'justify'> We must make the learned model accessible to users via an API once training is complete. For prediction, 
the saved pickle file and model are loaded first and then the predictions are made using it. If the web app 
works fine locally, the same app is deployed to the Streamlit cloud platform.</p>

## Implementation

<p align = 'justify'> Designed and deployed POC web application in Python and Streamlit for predicting the probability scores of financial 
transactions, accelerating decision-making for business users through real-time predictions.
